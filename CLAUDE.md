## CodeGraph & Graphify Architecture Sync

This repository is indexed by CodeGraph (.codegraph/).
To minimize token consumption, prevent hallucinations, and preserve context:
- **ALWAYS reach for CodeGraph FIRST** before using grep, glob, or reading raw source files.
- Use the MCP tool codegraph_explore or run codegraph explore "<symbol or question>" to understand code, relationships, and call paths in one call.
- Use codegraph node <symbol> to view exact symbol implementations and caller/callee trails.
- Never dump or read full large files into context unless actively modifying them.
